# geometry_competencies_puzzle_game

This repository represents a part of the implementation used for conducting the following research:

The rapid technological evolution of the last years motivated students to develop capabilities that will prepare them for an unknown future of the 21st century. In this context, many teachers intend to optimise the learning process and make it more dynamic and exciting by introducing gamification. Thus, this paper focuses on a data-driven assessment of geometry competencies, which are essential for developing problem-solving and higher-order thinking skills. Our main goal is to adapt, evaluate and compare Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT), Performance Factor Analysis (PFA), Elo and Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) algorithms applied to the data of a geometry game named Shadowspect, in order to predict students' performance by means of severfal classifier metrics. We analysed two algorithmic configurations (with and without prioritisation of Knowledge Components (KCs) - the skills needed to complete a puzzle successfully, and we found Elo to be the algorithm with the best prediction power with the ability to model the real knowledge of students However, the best results are achieved without KCs because it is a challenging task to differentiate well KCs in game environments. Our results prove that the above-mentioned algorithms can be applied in formal education to improve teaching, learning, and organisational efficiency.
